## Assignments
- Assignment 1: A C program that uses the `fork()`, `execl()`, `getpid()`, `getppid()` and `wait()` system functions.
- Assignment 2: A C program that uses the `pipe()` system function for bi-directional communication between parent and child process.
- Assignment 3: A C program that uses multi-threading and data parallelism to accomplish tasks faster with the `pthread_create()` and `pthread_join()` system functions.
- Assignment 4: A C program that uses the following three scheduling algorithms: First Come First Served, Shortest Job First, and Round Robin.
- Assignment 5: A C program that uses multi-threading and mutual exclusion to safely update shared values with the `pthread_mutex_init()`, `pthread_mutex_lock()`, `pthread_mutex_unlock()` and `pthread_mutex_destroy()`.
